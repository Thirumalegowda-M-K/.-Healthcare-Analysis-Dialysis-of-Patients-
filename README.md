# .-Healthcare-Analysis-Dialysis-of-Patients-
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare-related data using various tools such as Excel, Tableau, and SQL. The aim is to extract meaningful insights and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to support informed decision-making. The analysis involves creating dashboards and performing queries to summarize and evaluate the performance of healthcare organizations and patient statistics.

Key Tools Used:

Excel: For data cleaning, preliminary analysis, and dashboard creation.
Tableau: For advanced visualization and interactive dashboards.
SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and querying.

KPIs and Analysis Performed:

1)Number of Patients Across Various Summaries:
Analyzed patient distribution and trends across different demographics and categories.

2)Profit Vs Non-Profit Stats:
Evaluated performance and compared metrics between profit and non-profit healthcare organizations.

3)Chain Organizations w.r.t. Total Performance Score as No Score:
Investigated chain organizations with missing or zero performance scores and analyzed their impact.

4)Dialysis Stations Stats:
Summarized and visualized the performance and distribution of dialysis stations.

5)# of Category Text - As Expected:
Identified and summarized categories labeled as "As Expected" for compliance and quality metrics.

6)Average Payment Reduction Rate:
Calculated and analyzed average payment reduction rates across various organizations.

Project Deliverables

Excel Dashboard:
Interactive and visually appealing dashboard summarizing key insights.

Tableau Dashboard:
Advanced visualizations with filters and drill-down capabilities to explore the data dynamically.

SQL Queries:
Optimized and structured SQL queries used for data extraction and analysis.


Explore the following:

/Dashboard.xlsx: Contains Excel files with dashboards.
/Dashboard.twbx: Includes Tableau packaged workbooks (.twbx).
/sql healthcare project.sql: Folder with SQL scripts used in the analysis.
Open the respective files in Excel, Tableau, or your preferred SQL client to explore and replicate the analysis.

Insights and Findings:

Patient distribution trends revealed key demographics contributing to healthcare utilization.
Non-profit organizations exhibited different performance patterns compared to profit-driven organizations.
Identifying gaps in chain organizations with missing performance scores led to actionable recommendations.
Dialysis station statistics highlighted regional variations in healthcare infrastructure.
Categories labeled "As Expected" provided benchmarks for performance metrics.
Analysis of payment reduction rates identified opportunities for cost optimization.

Future Enhancements:

Incorporating machine learning models for predictive analysis.
Expanding data sources to include real-time data streams.
Adding more advanced visualizations in Tableau and Power BI.
